She was evaluated by a local physician several days prior to this presentation (1/7/91), for clumsiness of her right hand and falling. HCT and MRI brain revealed bilateral posterior clinoid masses.,MEDS:, Colace, Quinidine, Synthroid, Lasix, Lanoxin, KCL, Elavil, Tenormin.,PMH: ,1) Obesity.  2) VBG, 1990.  3) A-Fib. 4) HTN.  5) Hypothyroidism.  6) Hypercholesterolemia. 7) Briquet's syndrome: h/o of hysterical paralysis. 8) CLL, dx 1989; in 1992 presented with left neck lymphadenopathy and received 5 cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone chemotherapy; 10/95 parotid gland biopsy was consistent with CLL and she received 5 more cycles of chlorambucil/prednisone; 1/10/96, she received 3000cGy to right parotid mass. 9) SNHL,FHX:, Father died, MI age 61.,SHX:, Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.,EXAM:, Vitals were unremarkable.,The neurologic exam was unremarkable except for obesity and mild decreased PP about the right upper and lower face, diffusely about the left upper and lower face, per neurosurgery notes. The neuro-ophthalmologic exam was unremarkable, per Neuro-ophthalmology.,COURSE:, She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 1/8/91. This revealed a 15x17x20mm LICA paraclinoid/ophthalmic artery aneurysm and a 5x7mm RICA paraclinoid/ophthalmic artery aneurysm. On 1/16/91 she underwent a left frontotemporal craniotomy and exploration of the left aneurysm. The aneurysm neck went into the cavernous sinus and was unclippable so it was wrapped. She has complained of headaches since.\",\n          \"EXAM: , Digital screening mammogram.,HISTORY:,  51-year-old female presents for screening mammography.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.  Breast cancer was reported in her maternal aunt.,TECHNIQUE:,  Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  Comparison is made with the previous performed on mm/dd/yy. iCAD Second Look proprietary software was utilized.,FINDINGS:  ,The breasts demonstrate a mixture of adipose and fibroglandular elements.  Composition appears similar.  Multiple tiny punctate benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  No dominant mass, areas of architecture distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,IMPRESSION: , Stable and benign mammographic findings.  Continued yearly mammographic screening is recommended.,BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.,3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.\",\n          \"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Pneumatosis coli in the cecum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia.  The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Per his current medical chart.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.  He does have chronic alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.,VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile.  Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation.  Respiratory rate is 17-20.  Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s.,NECK:  Soft and supple, full range of motion.,HEART:  Regular.,ABDOMEN:  Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.  He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":67}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["grouped_data = medical_reports.groupby('medical_specialty').sample(110,random_state=42)"],"metadata":{"id":"QbD3sPB99V0o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820244,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}}},"execution_count":68,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["val_test_data = grouped_data.groupby('medical_specialty').sample(10,random_state=42)"],"metadata":{"id":"LO8PHA729YiV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820244,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}}},"execution_count":69,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["val = val_test_data.groupby('medical_specialty').head(5)\n","test = val_test_data.groupby('medical_specialty').tail(5)"],"metadata":{"id":"So8CAE4d9ejh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820244,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}}},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train = grouped_data[~grouped_data.index.isin(val_test_data.index)]"],"metadata":{"id":"DVKuHTK89fU9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820244,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}}},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(train)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"A0kRBXmR9id2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820244,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}},"outputId":"a9495dfc-aaf6-4f7a-c689-e3f4bf068501"},"execution_count":72,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["500"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":72}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"0gzUhIys9nb8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718875820395,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Emily Becher","userId":"16732133580474643015"}},"outputId":"f519388a-5f4f-4313-db19-ff24d403ba56"},"execution_count":73,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["               medical_specialty  \\\n","2135  Cardiovascular / Pulmonary   \n","1841  Cardiovascular / Pulmonary   \n","1823  Cardiovascular / Pulmonary   \n","2122  Cardiovascular / Pulmonary   \n","2047  Cardiovascular / Pulmonary   \n","...                          ...   \n","700                      Surgery   \n","74                       Surgery   \n","470                      Surgery   \n","880                      Surgery   \n","357                      Surgery   \n","\n","                                                 report  \n","2135  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

Pharmacologic stress testing was done using adenosine infusion.  Patient received 38 mg of adenosine infused at 140 mcg/kg/minute over a period of four minutes.  Two minutes during adenosine infusion, 31.6 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected.  Resting heart rate was 90 beats per minute.  Resting blood pressure was 130/70.  Peak heart rate obtained during adenosine infusion was 102 beats per minute.  Blood pressure obtained during adenosine infusion was 112/70.  During adenosine infusion, patient experienced dizziness and shortness of breath.  No significant ST segment, T wave changes, or arrhythmias were seen.,Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT showed uniform uptake of isotope throughout myocardium without any perfusion defect.  Gated dynamic imaging showed normal wall motion and normal systolic thickening throughout left ventricular myocardium.  Left ventricular ejection fraction obtained during adenosine Myoview SPECT was 77%.  Lung heart ratio was 0.40.

Normal left ventricular regional and global function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 77%.\",\n          \"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 48-year-old male who was initially seen in the emergency room on Monday with complaints of scapular pain.  The patient presented the following day with subcutaneous emphysema and continued complaints of pain as well as change in his voice.  The patient was evaluated with a CT scan of the chest and neck which demonstrated significant subcutaneous emphysema, a small right-sided pneumothorax, but no other findings.  The patient was admitted for observation.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Hernia repair and tonsillectomy.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin.,MEDICATIONS: , Please see chart.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Not contributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Well developed, well nourished, lying on hospital bed in minimal distress.,HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.,NECK:  Supple.  Trachea is midline.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, edema, or cyanosis.,SKIN:  The patient has significant subcutaneous emphysema of the upper chest and anterior neck area although he states that the subcutaneous emphysema has improved significantly since yesterday.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  As above.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 48-year-old male with subcutaneous emphysema and a small right-sided pneumothorax secondary to trauma.  These are likely a result of either a parenchymal lung tear versus a small tracheobronchial tree rend.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  At this time, the CT Surgery service has been consulted and has left recommendations.  The patient also is awaiting bronchoscopy per the Pulmonary Service.  At this time, there are no General Surgery issues.\",\n          \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Laryngeal edema.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tracheostomy change.  A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF.  The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.,2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,PROCEDURE:,  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Cardiovascular /

Gastrointestinal bleed, source undetermined, but possibly due to internal hemorrhoids.,2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.,3. Hypothyroidism.,PROCEDURE:,  Colonoscopy.,FINDINGS:,  Poor prep with friable internal hemorrhoids, but no gross lesions, no source of bleed.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the emergency room by Dr. X. He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood.  Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy.  A bowel prep was done.  H&Hs were stable.  His most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning.  His H&H at admission was 41/14.3.  The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding.  His vital signs are stable.  He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid.  His Plavix is discontinued.  He is given IV Protonix.  I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec.,The patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8.  Chemistry panel was unremarkable.  The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today.  He tolerated it well and is being discharged home.  He will be followed closely as an outpatient.  He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission.  He will hold his Plavix for now.  They will call me for further dark stools and will avoid Pepto-Bismol.  They will follow up in the office on Thursday.\",\n          \"CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST,REASON FOR EXAM: , Generalized abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and recent colonic resection in 11/08.,TECHNIQUE:,  Axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained without contrast.  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were then obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.,FINDINGS: , The liver is normal in size and attenuation.,The gallbladder is normal.,The spleen is normal in size and attenuation.,The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable.,The kidneys are normal in size and attenuation.,No hydronephrosis is detected.  Free fluid is seen within the right upper quadrant within the lower pelvis.  A markedly thickened loop of distal small bowel is seen.  This segment measures at least 10-cm long.  No definite pneumatosis is appreciated.  No free air is apparent at this time.  Inflammatory changes around this loop of bowel.  Mild distention of adjacent small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm is evident.  No complete obstruction is suspected, as there is contrast material within the colon.  Postsurgical changes compatible with the partial colectomy are noted.  Postsurgical changes of the anterior abdominal wall are seen.  Mild thickening of the urinary bladder wall is seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Marked thickening of a segment of distal small bowel is seen with free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.  An inflammatory process such as infection or ischemia must be considered.  Close interval followup is necessary.,2.  Thickening of the urinary bladder wall is nonspecific and may be due to under distention.  However, evaluation for cystitis is advised.\",\n          \"CLINICAL INDICATION:,  Chest pain.,INTERPRETATION: , The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest portion of the study and 11.5 mCi of Cardiolite for the stress portion of the study.,The patient's baseline EKG was normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was stressed according to Bruce protocol by Dr. X.  Exercise test was supervised and interpreted by Dr. X.  Please see the separate report for stress portion of the study.,The myocardial perfusion SPECT study shows there is mild anteroseptal fixed defect seen, which is most likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation artifact.  There is, however, mild partially reversible perfusion defect seen, which is more pronounced in the stress images and short-axis view suggestive of minimal ischemia in the inferolateral wall.,The gated SPECT study shows normal wall motion and wall thickening with calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.,CONCLUSION:,1.  The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall.,2.  Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":116}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["predicted_classes = []\n","ground_truth_classes = []\n","for line in test.iterrows():\n","    report, specialty = line[1][\"report\"], line[1][\"medical_specialty\"]\n","    ground_truth_classes.append(specialty.strip())  #
